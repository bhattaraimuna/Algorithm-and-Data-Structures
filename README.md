# Algorithm-and-Data-Structures
The repository consists of the labs assigned in CSE-3318-Algorithm and Data Structures at University of Texas at Arlington.

Lab-1: This lab is based on sorting concepts. It takes a sequence of n integer values and remove duplicate occurrences, allowing only the first occurrence
of each value to remain in the program.
